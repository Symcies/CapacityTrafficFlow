# CapacityTrafficFlow

Traffix Flow model

Language : C++


# Mesoscopic model 
This model deals with signalized intersections associated to a network. 
The cars travel into the network and they stop at signalized intersections : stop signs, traffic lights

These signalized intersections are modeled through a capacity / saturation flow. It expresses the maximum number of cars crossing the intersections per timestep.


# Outputs
The model is aimed to output :
- average duration of the cars in the network
- average length of queues
- ...
